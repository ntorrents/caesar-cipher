mouredev - Reto #24: CIFRADO CÉSAR

exercise proposed by mouredev. Number 24.

Create a program that performs the Caesar cipher of a text and prints it.
It must also be able to decrypt it when we tell it to.
I recommend that you look for information to know in depth how to perform encryption. This is also part of the challenge.
