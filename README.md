mouredev - Reto #24: CIFRADO CÉSAR

**STATEMENT**
Create a program that performs the Caesar cipher of a text and prints it.
It must also be able to decrypt it when we tell it to.
I recommend that you look for information to know in depth how to perform encryption. This is also part of the challenge.

**RULES**
Method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
